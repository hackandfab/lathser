Plan:

    - Use JSON input file format.
    - Make an in-memory mesh.
    - Specify on command line:
        - The axis of rotation
        - X,Y of center.
        - Number of steps.
    - Then:
        - For each step:
            - Transform model.
            - Fully render at high resolution, opaquely.
                - Use 2D point-in-polygon like PixelPlanes.
            - Detect edge. Can use one line per pixel or smooth it out.
            - Generate sequence of SVG.

To do next:

    - The model bounding box should only be calculated once, for all rotations,
        so that the model doesn't shift during rotation.
